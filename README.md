# CPsmaRt
The greatest HackIllinois Android Wear app of all time.

This app was submitted at HackIllinois on [Devpost](http://devpost.com/software/cpsmart).

CPsmaRt utilizes smart watches to help people perform CPR in emergency situations. By starting a CPR session, the user is periodically prompted to give compressions with haptic feedback, and animations. After 30 compressions the user is then told to give 2 rescue breaths, which is signified by distinct vibrations. The cycle then repeats. When a CPR session is started on the smart watch the user gets the most benefit. This is because they get haptic feedback and visual cues on their wrist. Available on iOS, Apple Watch, Android, and Android Wear.
